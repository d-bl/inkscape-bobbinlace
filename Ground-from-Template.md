_Under Construction_
--------------------

A slide show on [tesselace.com](https://tesselace.com/tools/inkscape-extension/) shows the available patterns. You need the number or name to select a file from the plugin-download and use it in the dialog.

For general purpose SVG editors you can also download the patterns via the GroundForge [gallery](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge/gallery.html). A single gallery item may represent different patterns.
