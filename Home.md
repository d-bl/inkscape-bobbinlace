*Welcome to the wiki for the bobbin lace related pugins for InkScape*

A collection of plugins by various authors.

## Installation

First download and install [InkScape].
Then download a [released] (or the most [recent]) version of the bobbin lace extensions and unpack.
The release contains a pair of  `.inx`/`.py` files for each plug-in.
Start InkScape and look for the location where to put these files:

    Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions

Once the files are in place and InkScape is restarted, the new extensions are available. Follow the same procedure to upgrade or downgrade an extension.

## Usage

The screenshot below shows the menu and dialogs of the plugins.
See the sidebar for further help pages.

* **Regular Grid** (created by [Veronika](https://github.com/veronika))
* **Polar Grid** (there is also [a web based](http://jo-pol.github.io/DiBL/polar-grids/) version)
* **Thread-style** (belongs to a [predecessor](https://d-bl.github.io/) of the web based [GroundForge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge))
* **Ground from Template** (also created by Veronika, the dialog asks for a file from the input directory of the download; a variant is embedded in GroundForge)
