*Welcome to the wiki for the bobbin lace related pugins for InkScape*

A collection of plugins by various authors.

## Installation

First download and install [InkScape].
Then download a [released] (or the most [recent]) version of the bobbin lace extensions and unpack.
The release contains a pair of  `.inx`/`.py` files for each plug-in.
Start InkScape and look for the location where to put these files:

    Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions

Once the files are in place and InkScape is restarted, the new extensions are available via the menu in the screenshot below. Follow the same procedure to upgrade or downgrade an extension.
