Pin distances
=============

Pin distances should more or less match the [thread size].
Multiply the desired radius by three and divide the result with the desired distance
to get a rough estimation of the required number of dots.
The value however changes from the inside to the outside.
The measurement tool of InkScape (available since release 0.91) can tell you any distance you want to know.
