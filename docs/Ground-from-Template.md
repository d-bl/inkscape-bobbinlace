Ground from Template
====================

- [Intro](#intro)
- [Applying a Template](#applying-a-template)


Intro 
-----

Two extensions generate patterns for bobbin lace grounds: pair diagrams that can serve as prickings.
One extension generates **straight** patches from templates, 
another other wraps the same patterns around a **circle**.
The templates come with the [installation] package.
An explanation to design your own templates sits at the bottom of the [plugin page of tesselace.com](https://tesselace.com/tools/inkscape-extension/).

More patterns, but fixed sized straight patches, are available for download from the [gallery] of GroundForge.
Of course you can copy-paste additional rows and columns and simply snap the copies into position.
A single gallery item may represent different patterns, each with the the pin positions nudged to different square grid positions.

[installation]: /inkscape-bobbinlace/


Applying a Template
-------------------

Browse with the file explorer/finder of your operating system
through the template directory which comes with the [installation] package.
You will see over 200 pairs of images and text files. the following screenshot shows just a few:

Copy paste the path of the text file for the desired pattern in the dialog of the plugin of your choice.

Most other parameters in the dialog parameters should speak for them selves.
The help pages for the grid extensions explain pin distances and footsides.
