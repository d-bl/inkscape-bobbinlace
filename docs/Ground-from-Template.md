Ground from Template

Intro 
-----

A couple of extensions generate patterns for bobbin lace grounds: pair diagrams that can serve as prickings.
One extension generates straight patches from templates, 
another other wraps the same patterns around a circle.
The templates come with the [installation] package.
An explanation to design your own templates sits at the bottom of the [plugin page of tesselace.com](https://tesselace.com/tools/inkscape-extension/).

More patterns, but fixed sized straight patches, are available for download from the [gallery] of GroundForge.
Of course you can copy-paste additional rows and colums and snap the copies into position.
A single gallery item may represent different patterns, nudging the pin positions to rectangular grid positions.

[installation]: /inkscape-bobbinlace/


Applying a Template
-------------------

Browse with the file explorer/finder of your operating system
through the template directory which comes with the [installation] package.
You will see over 200 pairs of images and text files. the following screenshot shows just a few:

Copy paste the path of the text file for the desired pattern in the dialog of the plugin of your choice.

Most other parameters in the dialog parameters should speak for them selves.
The help pages for the grid extensions explain pin distances and footsides.

Standard Deformations Tools
---------------------------

After generating a pattern, you can apply deformations with standard InkScape tools.
The following screenshots show just some examples in progress.

The following effects require to `combine` the desired objects into a single `path`.
In more complex situations the `select same...` function under the `edit` menu can pay off.
