##  Get rid of the clones and groups

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/d-bl/inkscape-bobbinlace/thread-style-images/TilesUngrouped.png">

The generated diagrams makes heavy use of clones and groups, these cause unexpected effects, so get rid of them.
Select everything on the page: CTRL-A or _edit - select all_.
The status bar shows the number of selected groups, clones and other things.
Unlink (SHIFT-ALT-D or _edit - clone - unlink_) and ungroup (SHIFT-CTRL-G or _object - ungroup_)
until the status bar only shows other things.
The clutter of bounding boxes shows that each dot and line segment is selected as an individual object.

# Apply color to the threads


In the crowded diagram, selecting a segment of a thread is easier with the node tool (F2), 
it briefly highlights the segment under the mouse.
The screen-shot below shows various changed threads and a selected segment, 
pushing the apply button will paint the whole thread copper.
The opened menu show how to get the dialog. 
You can keep the dialog open while selecting another segment.
