Installation
============

* If not yet done download and install [InkScape].

  Start InkScape and look for the location where to put the plugins:

      Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions

* Each plugin should have its own `.zip` file on the last [release] page.

  Download the desired one(s) and unzip. 
  
* Put the resulting `.inx`/`.py` files together in the location discovered with the first step.

* `template.zip` contains input for the [Ground from Template](Ground-from-Template) plugins. Put this folder somewhere you can easily find it.

Once the files are in place and InkScape is restarted, 
the new extensions are available via the `bobbin lace` menu under `extensions` as  shown in the screenshot below. 
Follow the same procedure to upgrade or downgrade an extension.
Please check that the version of the plugins match the version of InkScape.
