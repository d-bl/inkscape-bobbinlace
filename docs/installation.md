Installation
============

First download and install [InkScape].
Then download the desired bobbin lace extensions from the last [release] and unpack.

**Note:** plugin-version 0.7.x is compatible with InkScape 0.91.x, not with 0.92.x

* `template.zip` contains input for the [Ground from Template](Ground-from-Template) plugins. Put this folder somewhere you can easily find it.
* The other zip files are the bobbin lace related plugins and contain pairs of  `.inx`/`.py` files.

  Start InkScape and look for the location where to put these files:

      Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions

  Once the files are in place and InkScape is restarted, the new extensions are available via the `bobbin lace` menu under `extensions` as  shown in the screenshot below. Follow the same procedure to upgrade or downgrade an extension.
