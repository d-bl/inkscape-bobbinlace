# inkscape-bobbinlace
_InkScape extensions related to bobbin lace._

## Installation

First download and install [InkScape]. Then download a [released] (or the most [recent]) version of the bobbin lace extensions and unpack. The release contains a pair of  `.inx`/`.py` files for each plug-in. Start InkScape and look for the location where to put these files:

    Edit > Preferences > System: User extensions

Once the files are in place and InkScape is restarted, the new extensions are available. Follow the same procedure to upgrade or downgrade an extension.

## Usage

Below a screenshot with the menu and dialogs of the plugins.

* [Thread-style](https://github.com/jo-pol/DiBL/wiki/Thread-style) (belongs to a [predecessor](https://d-bl.github.io/) of the web based [GroundForge](https://d-bl.github.io/GroundForge))
* Ground from Template (also created by Veronika, the dialog asks for a file from the input directory of the download; a variant is embedded in GroundForge)
